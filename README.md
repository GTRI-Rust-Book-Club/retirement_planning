# Retirement Planning
## Motivation
A small group of coworkers aim to learn Rust through pair programming

## Task
Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire. It should prompt for your current age, the age you want to retire, the amount of savings you currently have, and the amount you want to have saved up by retirement.  You should then display a plot that takes the age you are currently and the amount you have saved up and displays the amount of money you need to save each year to retire on a given year.  So, if you have 0 savings and you want to retire with 1 million dollars, then the plot should demonstrate that to retire in a year, you would need to save 1 million dollars.  Feel free to change the rules if you think there's a more interesting set of data to look at with respect to retirement.
